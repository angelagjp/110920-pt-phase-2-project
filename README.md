# What King County Features Will Help Sell!



# Overview

This research is to find the features that will be the best predictor for increases in housing prices in king county. Linear regression models were used to measure just how much of an effect different attributes could have on the price of homes.

### The Data

The Data used in this was a combination of supplied data and researched data. The supplied data included the descriptive data of the house, such as, amount of bathroom, amount of bedrooms, and square footage. The researched data provided by the King County's Open Data resource included the population, landmarks, and crime rates of the area. As the new data was added there was a significant change in the correlation of the housing prices and the new features. 

### Business Problem

The problem of selling to buyers looking to sell for profit is that there needs to be future profit in mind. They are looking for a return on their investment. 

### Square footage

The first set of data that stood out was Square footage. When evaluating set of visualizations, it was cleat that Square footage was the best option og the given data. The best fit like was straighter on then the other option. The linear Regression model shows that at zero Square footage there isn't much of a profit but with each additional square footage there stands to make about $253 more than the original price. This increase is a great way to make predict return on investment going forward.

### Crime

The second set of data seemed significant was crime. As price goes up crime then goes up on average by 23. This could be because King county is a part of a major city, Seattle, so there is a higher probability of crime simply due to population density. However, giving your buyers the knowledge or area crime data might allow them to make an informed purchase for resale value.

### Landmarks 

Landmarks had a very significant effect of the pricing of the predictive pricing of housing. In particular Docton Forest, a 40 acre forest attraction, as housing price increased by 1 the forest area forest area value increased by about 6,065. The other features were not as significant but attractions provide a good predictive indicator of housing prices.

### Conclusions

In conclusion, Using the provided data and researched data we were able to model a linear regression model that showed that following elements are significant in predicting housing prices.
