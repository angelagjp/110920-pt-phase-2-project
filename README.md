## Overview

This research is to find the features that will be the best predictor for increases in housing prices in king county. Linear regression models were used to measure just how much of an effect different attributes could have on the price of homes.

### The Data

The Data used in this was a combination of supplied data and researched data. The supplied data included the descriptive data of the house, such as, amount of bathroom, amount of bedrooms, and square footage. The researched data provided by the King County's Open Data resource included the population, landmarks, and crime rates of the area. As the new data was added there was a significant change in the correlation of the housing prices and the new features. 

### Business Problem

The problem of selling to buyers looking to sell for profit is that there needs to be future profit in mind. They are looking for a return on their investment. 

### Square footage

The best fit like was straighter on then the other option. The linear Regression model shows that at zero Square footage there isn't much of a profit but with each additional square footage there stands to make about $255 more than the original price. This increase is a great way to make predict return on investment going forward.
