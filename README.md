# Overview

This research is to find the features that will be the best predictor for increases in housing prices in king county. Linear regression models were used to measure just how much of an effect different attributes could have on the price of homes.

### The Data

The Data used in this was a combination of supplied data and researched data. The supplied data included the descriptive data of the house, such as, amount of bathroom, amount of bedrooms, and square footage. The researched data provided by the King County's Open Data resource included the population, landmarks, and crime rates of the area. As the new data was added there was a significant change in the correlation of the housing prices and the new features. 

### Business Problem

### Livable Square footage

The first set of data that stood out was square footage of the interier living space. When evaluating set of visualizations, it was clear that this Square footage was the best option of the given data. The best fit line was straighter on then the other option. According to the linear regression model with every 212 square feet there is an increase in price. This increase is a great way to make predict return on investment going forward.


### Square footage from above 

The second set of data that stood out was the square footge above ground level. When looking into this number as the square footage increased by 57 square feet the price increased as well. This could help buyer when they are deciding between a ranch or a traditional multiple story dwelling.

Landmarks had a very significant effect of the pricing of the predictive pricing of housing. These landmarks included scheools, libraries, and food sources. The inclusions of landmarks jumped or model from having a variance of 55% to a variance of 72%. The shows that steering buyers to homes to self sustaining areas might help them get the best return in the long run.

### Conclusions
